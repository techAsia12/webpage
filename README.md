### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone the repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/techAsia12/webpage.git
cd webpage
```

### 2. 🚀 Backend Setup (Node.js)

Ready to get the backend running? Follow these steps to start the **Node.js** server and power your app! 💻✨

#### 1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:

Let’s get to the **backend** directory where all the magic happens:

```bash
cd backend
```

#### 2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:

Now that you're in the backend directory, let’s install all the dependencies we need. Don’t worry, **npm** (Node Package Manager) will take care of everything for you!

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3.**Start the Backend Server**:

All set up? Awesome! 🚀 Now, let’s start the Node.js backend server. With one simple command, your backend will come to life:

```bash
npm start
```


### 4. **Save Changes**:
Once you’ve pasted the section, make sure to **save** the file if you’re working locally.

- If you're working on GitHub directly, scroll to the bottom and add a commit message like "Updated backend setup section" and click **Commit changes**.

### 5. **View the Result**:
Once the changes are saved, you can view the updated **README.md** in your project folder or on GitHub. Your **Backend Setup** section will now look more attractive and engaging.

Let me know if you need help with any other part of the process! 😊

### 3. 🎨 Frontend Setup (HTML/CSS/JS)

Let's bring the **frontend** to life! 🌟 Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend of your application. All you need is **npm** and a browser! 🚀

#### 1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:

Head over to the **frontend** directory, where the magic happens. This is where all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are working together to give your app its look and feel:

```bash
cd frontend
```

#### 2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:

Now, it's time to install the **dependencies** for the frontend. npm will install all the required packages for the app to function smoothly. 🌈

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the libraries and tools that will power the frontend. 📦🔧

#### 3. **Start the Frontend Development Server**:

All set? It's showtime! 🎬 Start the frontend development server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the frontend at http://localhost:5173/ in your browser. 🎉

The server will automatically reload if you make changes to the frontend files. Now your frontend will be fully connected to the backend, fetching data and displaying it in real time! 🌐
